## 🧑‍🔬 Age Prediction using Deep Learning

### 🎯 Project Aim
The goal of this project is to develop a **deep learning model** to predict the **age** of individuals based on **facial images**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model is trained on a dataset of labeled facial images, where each image corresponds to the actual age of the individual. The model extracts key features from the images to accurately estimate age for unseen individuals.

### 🔥 Applications
- 📍 **Healthcare** - Age-based medical predictions
- 📍 **Marketing** - Targeted advertisements
- 📍 **Personalized Services** - Customized user experiences

### 📂 Dataset Information
We use a dataset containing facial images labeled with the corresponding ages. The dataset includes diverse images to improve model generalization.

📌 **Dataset Columns:**
- 🆔 `id` - Unique identifier for each image
- 🖼️ `image` - Facial image of the individual
- 📅 `age` - The actual age of the person in the image

### 🚀 Model Architecture
The model is built using **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**, a powerful deep learning approach for image-based tasks. The pipeline includes:
- 📌 **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- 📌 **Feature Extraction:** Convolutional layers extract patterns
- 📌 **Prediction:** Fully connected layers map extracted features to an age prediction

**Frameworks & Tools Used:**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
